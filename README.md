## Installing Anaconda 3 to use python

Before starting to show some exercises to learn python. We are going to install Anaconda: (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

For this case, I go to use the linux system, if you want to use Windows system, you need to follow other steps but it is not that different.

`First` download the anaconda3 installer by terminal: 
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
